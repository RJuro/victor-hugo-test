### Data Science? But why?
Get started with data science and machine learning with this PhD course for social science and humanities scholars!

The developments in computer science technologies and the increasing amount of accessible data presents a range of new methodological opportunities for the social sciences and humanities.

Data from websites, social media and electronic devices (often referred to as 'Big Data') allow for new approaches and perspectives on issues relevant for both the social sciences and humanities. Meanwhile, the increasing computational power and development of artificial intelligence algorithms provide the means for accessing, combining and analyzing a variety of data types (numerical, textual, relational) in new and meaningful ways.

This course is a hands-on practical introduction with no prerequisites in applying computer science techniques (like programming and machine learning) in humanities and social science research. It will cover a broad range of techniques and methods representing the latest methodological innovations in social science and humanities applications of machine learning and artificial intelligence.
Some techniques include:

- Collecting data from the web using web scraping methods and API's
- Processing textual data for quantitative analysis (Natural Language Processing)
- Working and visualizing networks (network analysis)
- Dimensionality reduction and clustering techniques (topic models and k-means clustering)
- Visualization techniques for text data and networks
- Building and understanding machine learning classifiers

This course is meant as a hands-on tools workshop focusing on the practical use of these methods and will not go in depth with the mathematical and theoretical foundations. It will rather provide a broad overview of the data science ecosystem and toolbox and enable immediate application.

### Structure / Teaching format
Each day will consist of a mixture of lectures and exercises using interactive online notebooks allowing participants to try out and use the various methods as they are being taught. Participants are expected to work on a portfolio during the week with each day having hours dedicated to portfolio work with the possibility of sparring with the course lecturers. Here, participants will work on applying the methods and techniques presented to their own work.
